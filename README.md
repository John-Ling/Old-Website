I wanted to make a portfolio website because even after programming for nearly 3 years, my experience in programming was mainly focused on console apps, desktop applications and embedded systems. I've always wanted to build a website to express my creative side and I got that opportunity to do so during 2022's Summer. 

The colour scheme is based off one of my favourite VScode themes "Tokyo Night" by Enkia. I made some minor adjustments to the colour scheme to my liking.

I used Bootstrap, Sass and vanilla Javascript for the website itself and the site is hosted on a London-based Digital Ocean server running NGINX.
