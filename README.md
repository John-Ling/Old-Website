I made this website in 2022 nearly 3 years from my start in programming back in 2019. Why it took me this long to enter web development is beyond me. 

I think personal websites are a cool way to express yourself and I had a lot of fun designing and building the site. I plan to add a blogging function to the website so I can document the projects that I don't upload to Github and go into greater depth about interesting things I have done. 

The colour scheme is based off one of my favourite VScode themes "Tokyo Night" by Enkia and I made some minor adjustments to the colour scheme to my liking.
I used Bootstrap, Sass and Javascript for the website itself and the site is hosted on an Oracle Cloud VPS through NGINX.
